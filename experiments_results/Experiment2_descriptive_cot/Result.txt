Often too many lines resulting in propblems of creating an 8 by 8 image. 

The white lines in the beginning 
and end are disturbing and lead to too many rows of pixel. 

Tries to copy the exact parts that I have used 
like horizontal line, point, loop. But they are not always enough 

Resulting changes: 
In general
- use more objects to draw so that the set is complete to draw all my test cases
- use less examples so GPT3 is not focused too much on them
- maybe also a hint to use larger images

to make sure the not more than 8 rows
- Leave out the parts of describing the empty rows and just add them to other elements
- Describe better that it should not be more than 8 rows
- The same format for all examples: divide the images in same sized parts
