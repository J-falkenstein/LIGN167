Images displayed on a computer screen are actually a collection of dots of color, called pixels. If you look really closely at the screen, you will be able to see the individual pixels. The collection of pixels that make up an image are stored as a matrix.
We can represent different objects (e.g., numbers, letters, or shapes) by creating a pixel matrix which consists of 0s and 1s. The matrix should be of the size 8 by 8. Each entry represents a pixel of a black or a white pixel. That means the image has a display capable of 8 pixels in width and 8 pixels in height. Since there are only 64 pixels in total the objects to be displayed are significantly simplified. In the following examples, the images are created step-by-step from top to bottom. 

Here is an example of an 8 by 8 pixel matrix showing the number three:
First, the first two rows of the pixel matrix:
00000000
00111110
Then the middle part of the image:
00000110
00111100
00001110
00000110
Last, the last two rows of the pixel matrix:
00111100
00000000
###

Here is an example of a grid of pixels that form an image of the number two:
First, the first two rows of the pixel matrix:
00000000
00111100
Then the middle part of the image:
01100110
00001100
00011000
00110000
Last, the last two rows of the pixel matrix:
01111110
00000000
###

Here is an example of an 8 by 8 pixel matrix showing the letter F:
First, the first two rows of the pixel matrix:
01111110
01100000
Then the middle part of the image:
01000000
01111110
01100000
01000000
Last, the last two rows of the pixel matrix:
01000000
00000000

Here is an example of a grid of pixels that form an image of the letter Z:
First, the first two rows of the pixel matrix:
11111111
00000011
Then the middle part of the image:
00000110
00011000
00110000
01100000
Last, the last two rows of the pixel matrix:
11000000
11111111

Here is an example of an 8 by 8 pixel matrix showing a colon:
First, the first two rows of the pixel matrix:
00000000
00001100
Then the middle part of the image:
00001100
00000000
00001100
00001100
Last, the last two rows of the pixel matrix:
00000000
00000000
###

Here is an example of a grid of pixels that form an image of an equal sign:
First, the first two rows of the pixel matrix:
00000000
11111111
Then the middle part of the image:
11111111
00000000
00000000
00000000
Last, the last two rows of the pixel matrix:
11111111
11111111
